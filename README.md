## Abstract

This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
options for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 to explicitly
signal available upstream and downstream data rates. In many broadband
access networks, Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) and intermediate
nodes lack visibility into the subscriber's provisioned service tier.
By communicating these capacities natively via DHCP, clients, relay agents,
and snooping switches can dynamically configure localized traffic shaping
and queuing. This explicit signaling improves overall network performance
by reducing the reliance on indiscriminate packet dropping and policing at the
service edge. Additionally, it provides the necessary capacity awareness
to enable effective Active Queue Management (AQM) and the Low Latency,
Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture.
